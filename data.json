Patients achieving no response receive GM-CSF for an additional 3 months. Patients failing to achieve a partial response or better after the second course of GM-CSF are removed from the study. Patients achieving a partial response after the first or second course of GM-CSF continue to receive GM-CSF for an additional 9 months. Patients are then re-evaluated. Patients achieving a complete cytologic response at 9 months then receive GM-CSF 3 times weekly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nPatients are followed every 2 weeks.\n\nPROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."

The biomarkers of exposure will be measured in blood and urine samples collected from the subjects. Moreover, the biomarkers in subjects smoking conventional or SMAR cigarettes will be compared with those biomarkers in smokers who stop smoking for 5 days. The short term safety of this new product will also be evaluated.",

Subjects will be discharged in the morning of D6. From the discharge of the subject, a 7-day safety follow-up period will be carried out (until D13)."

                    "briefSummary": "Suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, and suicide are increasingly common in adolescence.\n\nCurrent face-to-face prevention approaches are of limited effectiveness, rely on extensive resources, and are at odds with adolescents' digital preferences. We will evaluate two unconventional but promising interventions delivered to 13- to 17-year-olds: transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation to target emotion dysregulation, and a peer-support smartphone app to combat social isolation. If effective, these digitally-delivered interventions could reach far more adolescents at far lower cost than current approaches.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Over the past two decades, suicide rates have increased nearly 35% in the U.S., with upward trends in nearly all demographic groups. Further increases have occurred since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Despite ambitious goals for reducing suicides and significant federal and private investment, suicide rates continue to rise unabated. To date, the predominant approach to mitigating suicide risk in the U.S. is secondary prevention. Typically, these programs identify risk of recurrence among those who have already attempted suicide at least once. Although secondary prevention is crucial, the majority of deaths by suicide occur on first attempt. Thus, targeted primary prevention earlier in development is essential. Most current primary prevention programs are intensive, expensive, and delivered by highly trained mental health providers, who are in short supply. Traditional face-to-face therapy is also unavailable to many who live in underserved communities, and disliked by adolescents, who much prefer digital delivery on their devices. This high-risk, high-reward proposal addresses these limitations and needs. We use an experimental therapeutics approach to evaluate the independent and combined efficacies of two unconventional but scalable interventions: transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) to target emotion dysregulation, and a peer-support smartphone app to combat social isolation. These low-cost interventions, which hold strong promise but have not been used before, can reach large numbers of adolescents, with much potential to reduce prospective suicide risk. We will enroll 212 adolescents, ages 13-17 years, who show elevations on at least two prominent risk factors for suicide (e.g., self-injury, maltreatment).\n\nUsing a 2 × 2 design, adolescents will be assigned randomly to receive 30 days of treatment with:\n\n1. tVNS to target emotion dysregulation,\n2. a peer-support phone app to target social isolation,\n3. tVNS + a peer-support phone app, or\n4. enhanced treatment as usual with monitoring and access to resources.\n\nIntervention effects on mechanisms (emotion dysregulation, social isolation) proximal efficacy signals (e.g., physiological reactivity, self-harm) and target outcomes (suicidal ideation, suicidal behaviors) will be evaluated immediately post-intervention and at one-year follow-up. Treatment data will be monitored daily to fine-tune dosing of both interventions. This transformative and innovative proposal tests two novel, scalable preventive interventions designed to \"meet adolescents where they are\" by using digital technologies to address core mechanisms of suicide risk."

Determine whether genistein treatment will decrease the number of circulating prostate cells (CPCs) in the peripheral blood as measured by qRT-PCR for PSA performed on RNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the natural history of circulating prostate cells (CPCs) in a cohort of subjects prior to and post radical prostatectomy.\n\nII. Compare the measurement of PSA between three separate methods: in CPCs by qRT-PCR, in serum by the standard clinical chemistry assay (i.e., ELISA), and in plasma and serum by the nano-PSA assay.\n\nIII. Measure the effect of genistein on gene and protein expression in prostate tissue by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively, for the following genes and their respective protein products: HSP27, MMP-2, ALK-2, BASP1, and HCF2.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive oral genistein once daily for 3 months beginning at least 1 month prior to radical prostatectomy.\n\nARM II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 3 months beginning at least 1 month prior to radical prostatectomy.\n\nAll patients undergo radical prostatectomy at least 2 weeks, but not more than 3 months following the start of therapy.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1, 6, and 12 months."

The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Is BUFY01 non-inferior to SVS20 in terms of signs of DED?\n* Is BUFY01 non-inferior to SVS20 in terms of symptoms of DED?\n\nParticipants will be asked to:\n\n* Visit the trial site at 4 different timepoints\n* Use the allocated study treatment everyday until the end of the study (during 3 months)\n* Be examined by the investigator\n* Complete several questionnaires\n* Return unused study treatment.\n\nResearchers will compare BUFY01 to SVS20 to see if both study treatments provide similar effects on signs and symptoms of the disease, together with comparable safety."

All the cervical specimens of cytology collected in the clinical settings will be utilized for the testing of DNA methylation, high-risk HPV subtypes and thin prep liquid-based cytology test (TCT). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were calculated based on the known histological results. The differences of DNA methylation with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) and TCT will also be analyzed.\n\nThe testing of DNA methylation will be performed with the methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The TCT and HPV testing will be performed with the Roche kits."
